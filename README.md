Overview

Since 2008, Airbnb has assisted visitors and hosts in travelling in a more special and personalised manner. Thanks to its enthusiastic founder, Brian Chesky, the firm grew from a mattress to a multinational enterprise estimated at more than $30 billion. The year 2020 was expected to be a watershed moment, when Airbnb would go public and announce the world's most valuable stock. Corona virus occurred, which was tragic, the pandemic devastated the tourism industry. 

However, it cannot be denied that Airbnb has redefined Hospitality. The sharing economy and vacation rentals are among the hottest topics that have touched millions of lives worldwide. Airbnb is a worldwide marketplace that allows users to book or to offer lodging and tourism experiences. Airbnb has been instrumental in the hospitality service and currently operates in more than 191 countries. This service is accessible via their website or mobile apps. 

This visualisation project aims to analyse and determine popular rental neighbourhoods in New York and to estimate how much it would cost if someone were planning a trip here. The visualisations are designed to explore popular neighbourhoods based on the traveller’s preferences if they travelled or transited in New York and its neighbourhoods.

To acquire the most up-to-date data, this project used New York City’s dataset from InsideAirbnb, which is an independent platform offering non-commercial datasets from Airbnb. The primary csv dataset is from New York in June 2020 with over 106 different dimensions. It was interesting sorting through the data and finding relevant dimensions for the visualisations. The data is extracted into a secondary subset containing a number of listings per neighbourhood, which is used exclusively in the visualisations.

Domain Questions

Airbnb is most frequently used by tourists, so we explore the various factors that influence tourists' decisions on where to stay when travelling. The interactive map will use spatial visualisation to explore different variables from dataset and answer questions about price fluctuations and ratings through various locations of New York City.

The storyboard has been categorised into four categories:
•	Overview of Airbnb
•	Property analysis
•	Pricing analysis
•	Host analysis

Some of the target questions are: 
•	What is the average price by accommodation types?
•	What kinds of accommodation types are more prevalent in the different New York neighbourhoods?
•	Number of Reviews over time
•	Host/Super Host vs Price over time
